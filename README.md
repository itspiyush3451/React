   Quickly scaffold React components and more with helpful snippets.

2. **Prettier - Code Formatter**  
   Maintain consistent code formatting across your projects.

3. **React Developer Tools**  
   Debug your React applications with ease (install as a browser extension too).

4. **Bracket Pair Colorizer**  
   Helps identify matching brackets for better readability.

5. **VS Code Icons**  
   Makes it easier to recognize file types in the file explorer.

6. **Auto Import**  
   Automatically import required components or modules.
